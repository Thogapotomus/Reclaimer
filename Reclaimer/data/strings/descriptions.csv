thog_reclaimer,SHIP,"Versatility. Whether in the depths of debris fields or exploring past the fringes of civilized space, the need for a ship that can adapt to any job cannot be overstated. The Reclaimer was purpose built to provide flexibility to those who will be spending extended lengths of time away from port. The capital grade salvage bay enables the Reclaimer to singlehandedly strip entire debris fields bare, while the built in damper field, running in a low power mode, allows traversal through the field with impunity. An advanced sensor array allows the Reclaimer to keep an eye out for danger while it remains safely obscured in the debris field and a dedicated planetary survey bay ensures groundside operations can be performed with peak efficiency.",,,,
